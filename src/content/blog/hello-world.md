This is the first post on my new site. I've been meaning to start writing publicly for a while, and here we are.

I plan to write about:

- **Machine learning in production** — the messy reality of shipping models at scale
- **Engineering leadership** — lessons from managing data science and ML teams
- **Tools and workflows** — things I've built or adopted that make work better
- **Ideas** — half-formed thoughts on AI, tech, and how we build things

If any of that sounds interesting, stick around. More coming soon.
