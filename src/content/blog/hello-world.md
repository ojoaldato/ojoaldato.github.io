This is the first post on my new site. I've been meaning to start writing publicly for a while, and here we are.

I plan to write about:

- **Software engineering** — full stack development, system design, and the craft of building reliable software
- **Machine learning in production** — the messy reality of shipping models at scale
- **Engineering leadership** — lessons from leading software engineering and data science teams
- **Tools and workflows** — things I've built or adopted that make work better
- **Money and markets** — personal finance, investing, and how technology is reshaping both
- **The digital world** — how the internet, AI, and software are quietly rewriting the rules of society
- **Life, loosely** — observations on culture, work, and the things that don't fit neatly into a category

If any of that sounds interesting, stick around. More coming soon.
